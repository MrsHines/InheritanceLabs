# InheritanceLabs
The Java files accompanying the Inheritance assignments.  

See the word document in Teams for the description of the project. 

For every class include the following documentation:

Comments at the beginning of the file with a short description of the class, your name, and the date.

A comment before each variable explaining the purpose of the variable.
Comments before each method describing what the method does, its parameters (@param) and what it returns (@return)

If the variable name or method name is self documenting, you do not have to include the description.  ** You will still need to include the @param and @return for methods!
